fix meshline problem: create a new project and use only meshline.
troubleshoot further by looking at the error again.


Problem is @react/three-fiber is incompatible with three.meshline
final solution, just copy the versions from zustand


add shooting stars => two types, one with the line thing and the other with the sphere technique you are trying to do
- What if you rotate the star dome instead?

onStarHover, play a tone in the key using javascript
